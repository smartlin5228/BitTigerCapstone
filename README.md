# BitTiger Capstone Project
## Project Track
__Track 1 - Data Mining and Analysis System for Cloudacl__

## Project Objective:

* Building a data pipeline with the functionalities including but not limited to data processing, data storage and data visualization.

* Extracting data features and making recommendations based on the results

## Project Introduction:
Cloudacl is the leading provider of security and infrastructure service
that make the Internet safer through integrated Web content filtering. It provides
plugin for Chrome, Firefox, and mobile app for android and iPhone. Every
browser request will go through our cloud service and will be classified according
